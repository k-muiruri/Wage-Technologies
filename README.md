# Wage-Technologies
Wage Technologies enforces an iterative system with distributed programing. This repository establishes the backend of the interface that will be exercised by employers in setting up and then implementing their workplace in the application. The code requires input over a variety of fields, including but not limited to: style of workplace, number of and identifiers to employees, needed shifts and their difficulty, and more. 

Code requirements are as follows:

Create an enum list of potential places to work. If one of the suggested is chosen, provide a base list of occupations to fill. Provide an option for the employer to label each employee as “general.” If other, request occupations. 

Develop a Shifts interface, the implementation of which requests difficulty metric from the employer.

Develop an Employee interface that returns essentials for each employee to be entered in the system. Implement each employee accordingly, as desired by each
